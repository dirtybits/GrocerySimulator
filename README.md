# GrocerySimulator

GrocerySimulator is a project that simulates point-of-sale traffic in a grocery store and outputs analysis including but not limited to:

-average time spent at the register 
-the average number of items customers had

This program also provides a GUI for the user to watch the traffic as well as the output of the simulation.
