# GrocerySimulator

GrocerySimulator is a project that simulates point-of-sale traffic in a grocery store and outputs analysis including but not limited to:

* average time spent at the register 
* the average number of items customers had 
* the number of customers served

This program provides a GUI for the user to watch the traffic as well as the output of the simulation.

Simply click "Run Simulation" and it will begin. 
Note that after you press "Stop", you will need to wait till the remaining customers have been checked out before the simulation stops and outputs its analysis.
