# GrocerySimulator

GrocerySimulator is a project that simulates point-of-sale traffic in a grocery store and outputs analysis such as average time spent at the register, the average number of items customers had, the number of customers served, and so forth.
This program also provides a GUI for the user to watch the traffic as well as the output of the simulation.
